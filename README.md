- 👋 Hi, I’m @mmilunicmobile
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematics, computer science, and music. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write not bad college essays, general coding stuff, and differential equations.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... stuff? That doesn't serve much of a good purpose but is cool or actually does serve a purpose and is cool?
- 📫 You can reach me at an undisclosed email.
